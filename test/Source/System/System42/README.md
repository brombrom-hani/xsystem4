Note
----

I am not 100% sure about the legality of distributing System40.exe and
Sys42VM.dll here, so I've left them out. They can be found in the System 4 SDK,
which you'll want to have anyways to compile these tests.

Once you've copied the files, this directory should contain the following:

    System40.exe
    System40.ini
    DLL\Sys42VM.dll
